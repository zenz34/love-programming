 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'
 *
 * Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, Â return an array output such
 * that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except
 * nums[i].
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:  [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: [24,12,8,6]
 * 
 * 
 * Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does
 * not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
